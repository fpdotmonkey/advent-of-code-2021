# Advent of Code 2021

I'm doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge for 2021.
It's your standard solve-cute-code-problems fair, but I'm adding the twist that
I'll only use any language for 1 day, meaning 25 different programming languages
by the end.  I'll keep a list of languages below.

1. Mathematica (a.k.a. Wolfram Language)
2. Python
3. Rust
